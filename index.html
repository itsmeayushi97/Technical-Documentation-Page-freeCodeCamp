           <p>
             C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
               </p>

<p>
  C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.
               </p>

                        <p>
                          C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.
               </p>

<p>
  Some of the features & key-points to note about the programming language are as follows:
               </p>
  <ol>
      <li>Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich libray support and a variety of data-types.</li>
      <li>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent: A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.</li>
       <li>Mid-level language: It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</li>
      <li>Rich library support: Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.</li>
      <li>Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as grabage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.</li>
       <li>Pointer and direct Memory-Access: C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).</li>
      <li>Object-Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.
         <li>Compiled Language: C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</li>

    Similarities between C and C++ are: 
 </p>
<ol>
<li>Both the languages have a similar syntax.
Code structure of both the languages are same.</li>
<li>The compilation of both the languages is similar.</li>
<li>They share the same basic syntax. Nearly all of C’s operators and keywords are also present in C++ and do the same thing.</li>
<li>C++ has a slightly extended grammar than C, but the basic grammar is the same.
Basic memory model of both is very close to the hardware.</li>
<li>Same notions of stack, heap, file-scope and static variables are present in both the languages.</li>     
     </ol>
     <p>Difference between C and C++ are:  </p>
                        <p>
     The main difference between both these languages is C is a procedural programming language and does not support classes and objects, while C++ is a combination of both procedural and object-oriented programming languages.                       </p>

                        To get started with writing C++, open the compiler you have and write your first "Hello world"
                        C++
                        code:
                        <code>// Your First C++ Program

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
                        </code>

                          <p> Now run the code in your compiler and see the output.</p>

             <h2>Variables</h2>
          </header>
                    <p>
                        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    </p>
      <p>
   The C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
</p>
          <p>
C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C++.                    </p>
<p>
                       Some examples of legal names are:
Piyush,
abc,
move_name,
a_123,
myname50,
_temp,
j,
a23b9,retVal.

                    <article>
                        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier
                      </p>As the name suggests the name constants is given to such variables or values in C++ programming language which cannot be modified once they are defined.</p>
                  <p>They are fixed values in a program. There can be any types of constants like integer, float, octal, hexadecimal, character constants etc. Every constant has some range
  </p>                      
      <p> Defining Constants:
In C/C++ program we can define constants in two ways as shown below:</p>
<p>1. Using #define preprocessor directive</p>
<p>2. Using a const keyword  </p>                 
  <p><b>1. Using #define preprocessor directive:</b> This directive is used to declare an alias name for existing variable or any value. We can use this to declare a constant as shown below:</p>
<code>#define identifierName value</code>
<p>identifierName: It is the name given to constant.</p>
<p>value: This refers to any value assigned to identifierName.</p>
                  <p><b>Example:</b>      </p>                    <code>#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
#define val 10  
#define floatVal 4.5  
#define charVal 'G'  
  
int main() { 
    cout << "Integer Constant: " << val << "\n";  
    cout << "Floating point Constant: " << floatVal << "\n";  
    cout << "Character Constant: "<< charVal << "\n";  
      
    return 0;  
}           
         </code>
  <p> 2.<b>using a const keyword:</b> Using const keyword to define constants is as simple as defining variables, the difference is you will have to precede the definition with a <i>const</i> keyword.                
 <code>
   #include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
   
int main() { 
    // int constant 
    const int intVal = 10;  
  
    // Real constant 
    const float floatVal = 4.14; 
   
    // char constant  
    const char charVal = 'A';  
  
    // string constant 
    const string stringVal = "ABC";  
       
    cout << "Integer Constant: " << intVal << "\n";  
    cout << "Floating point Constant: " << floatVal << "\n";  
    cout << "Character Constant: "<< charVal << "\n";  
    cout << "String Constant: "<< stringVal << "\n"; 
       
    return 0;  
}

<p>  C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Less than: a < b </li>
<li>Less than or equal to: a <= b </li>
<li>Greater than: a > b </li>
<li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b

<li>Not Equal to: a != b </li>
  </ol>
<p>You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.</p>

<p>C++ has the  following conditional statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
<li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
<li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
<li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed </li>    </ol>

                    <article>
                        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
<code>while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}</code>
  If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

                        <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
 <p>In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:
 </p>
        Example:
     <code>   int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;

 <ol><li><b> Return Type −</b> A function may return a value. The <b>return_type</b> is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword <b>void</b>.
   </li>
<li><b>Function Name</b> − This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
</li>
<li><b>Parameters</b> − A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
</li>
<li><b>Function Body</b> − The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
